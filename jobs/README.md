This directory has some sample job calls in it to illustrate how to submit jobs to Anyscale and Ray from the command line.

Here's how to submit these jobs.  These are just examples to start from; whether or not they succeed depends on what kind of cloud you're using and how it it set up.

`anyscale job submit job_from_git.yaml`
`anyscale job submit job_gcp_cloud.yaml`
`anyscale job submit job_s3.yaml`
`anyscale job submit job_s3_managed.yaml`
